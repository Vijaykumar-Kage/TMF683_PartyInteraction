# TMF683_UserInteraction
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) User Interaction API

Users are communicating constantly with our enterprises either calling, entering our stores 
or using our websites and apps. Our companies are also communicating with them proactively by 
sending them new offers and providing support through different channels. Sometimes it is 
different to keep track of all those actions througout all channels. A User Interaction 
captures information about past interactions in order to re-use it in future ones. This allows 
agents to serve users better by knowing the steps they went through. It also allows 
customers to see better the actions they have performed and how they interacted with us. The 
User Interactions API provides a mechanism to manage user interactions. Creation, update and 
retrieval.
